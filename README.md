I programmed this game using JavaScript, it is a single player casual game. 
It consists of a circle that you can move using the arrow keys, and other circles that you must avoid.
If your circle gets hit, you lose a life, and you have 3 lives. Your circle is also given 100 bullets. 
These bullets are released using the WASD controls for each direction.
Along with avoiding the circles you must shoot all the circles in the field to advance to the next phase.
In one of the phases, the other circles shoot back.
